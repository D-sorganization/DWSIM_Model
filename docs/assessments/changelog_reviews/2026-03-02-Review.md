# Code Quality Review: 2026-03-02

## 1. Coherent Plan Alignment
The recent commits introduce a `GasificationFlowsheet` capable of switching between standard, equilibrium, and custom mixed modes. The implementation in `src/dwsim_model/gasification.py` appears to align with the goal of creating a multi-physics supported flowsheet architecture. Tests were added to verify the basic functionality.

## 2. Damaging Changes
None found.

## 3. Truncated/Incomplete Work
The `_configure_reactors` method in `GasificationFlowsheet` is heavily truncated. It sets up empty `if` blocks mapping operation properties, but relies strictly on "pass" and "To-Do" comments instead of configuring the actual parameters.

## 4. Placeholders (TODO, FIXME)
- `src/dwsim_model/gasification.py`:
  - `To-Do: Programmatically add specific Conversion Reactions via DWSIM Simulation Data e.g., Biomass -> a*CO + b*H2 + c*CH4 + d*CO2` (Line 188)
  - `To-Do: Configure isothermal operation and add WGS/Methanation equilibrium reactions.` (Line 196)
  - Also, missing properties for `trc` configuration: `trc.Volume = 2.0` and `trc.Length = 5.0` are commented out. (Line 203, 204)

## 5. Workarounds
The `try...except` block during Connection Mapping only issues a warning instead of raising the error if partial connections fail. This could be considered a workaround allowing the model to enter an invalid layout state silently:
```python
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Connection layout partial due to: {e}")
```

## 6. CI/CD Gaming
No evidence of CI/CD gaming found.
