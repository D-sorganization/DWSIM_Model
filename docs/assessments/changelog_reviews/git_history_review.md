## Recent Commits

### 1. `29c759e` - fix: resolve CI failures in build-docs and quality-gate
**Review:**
- **Coherent plan alignment:** The commit resolves CI failures by prefixing unused variables in `tests/test_gasification_build.py` and `tests/test_builder.py`, as well as in `src/dwsim_model/gasification.py` with `_` to suppress `flake8`/`ruff` warnings for unused variables (e.g. `_gasifier`, `_ms`, etc.). This aligns with fixing linting issues.
- **Damaging changes:** None detected. This is a standard cleanup commit.
- **Truncated/incomplete work:** No.
- **Placeholders (TODO, FIXME):** It leaves the `To-Do` comments in `src/dwsim_model/gasification.py` untouched, as they were introduced in a previous commit.
- **Workarounds:** Prefixing unused variables with `_` is a common Python workaround for unused variables, specifically when you still want to define them for some reason (e.g., they might be needed later or the initialization itself has side effects). In the tests, it's fine since it just tests `add_object`.
- **CI/CD gaming:** While prefixing with `_` does bypass the linter check, in test cases it's an acceptable way to assert an object is created without using it further. However, in `gasification.py`, `_gasifier`, `_pem`, and `_trc` are assigned in `_configure_reactors` but never used, indicating incomplete implementation.

### 2. `21a0a8b` - feat(gasification): Add dynamic ReactorMode switching for multi-physics support
**Review:**
- **Coherent plan alignment:** This merge commit brings in a large chunk of work. It introduces `GasificationFlowsheet` and `FlowsheetBuilder` to programmatically build a DWSIM flowsheet. The implementation maps to the PR description (dynamic ReactorMode switching).
- **Damaging changes:** None detected.
- **Truncated/incomplete work:** Yes. The method `_configure_reactors` in `src/dwsim_model/gasification.py` contains `pass` statements for the configuration of all three reactors (Downdraft Gasifier, PEM, TRC). The user is instructed to access properties directly via `builder.operations["ReactorName"]`. This is definitely incomplete work.
- **Placeholders (TODO, FIXME):**
  - `To-Do: Programmatically add specific Conversion Reactions via DWSIM Simulation Data`
  - `To-Do: Configure isothermal operation and add WGS/Methanation equilibrium reactions.`
  - `Set default volume/length (requires DWSIM property setters mapped to .NET types)`
- **Workarounds:** The `run` method catches a generic `Exception` from `builder.calculate()`, but the DWSIM solver itself might fail silently or throw exceptions depending on setup. Also, the `.NET` exception handling in `core.py` is quite broad.
- **CI/CD gaming:** None detected.

## Summary

The recent history introduces a robust foundation for building a DWSIM flowsheet via Pythonnet (`FlowsheetBuilder` and `GasificationFlowsheet`).

However, there is **significant incomplete work and placeholders**:
1. `_configure_reactors` in `GasificationFlowsheet` uses `pass` statements and contains explicit "To-Do" comments indicating that reactor parameters (conversion factors, equilibrium reactions, volume/length) are not yet implemented.
2. Unused variables in `_configure_reactors` (`_gasifier`, `_pem`, `_trc`) were prefixed with `_` to pass the linter, effectively "gaming" the CI/CD pipeline since the configuration logic is entirely missing.

### Action Items
- An issue should be created to track the completion of the `_configure_reactors` method.
- The `To-Do` comments need to be addressed to make the flowsheet fully functional, rather than just building the topology.
